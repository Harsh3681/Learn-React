Pass data from a parent component to a child component, and are immutable and owned by the parent component. 
Props are used to pass data and configuration, and are accessed using this.props or as function arguments.


ğŸ‘‰ğŸ‘‰ğŸ‘‰ State
Manages local data storage that is specific to a component, and is mutable and owned by the component itself. 
State is used to manage component-specific data and UI state changes, such as handling user input, 
controlling UI behavior, and storing temporary data. State is accessed using this.state in class components
or via state hooks in functional components.
