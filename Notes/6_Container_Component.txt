in 2expence-management project in Components we make 
"Container" Component which will take an there own define CSS 
i.e "Container.module.css"

we use this "Container" Component as in our App.js folder instead of "Fragments"
or along with fragments <></>

this will helpful to make our code more crisp and clear.

here main use of such Container is that if we want to create certain "Cards" "Post"
in project and we are dynamically change our contain inside that Cards and all
in such cases this will very helpful for us because the only 

inner sections,content will change and outer things we will keept same
means inside "Container" we can place it because of "props.children" we can access
children means any content, tag, component places in "Container Component" directly 
and our "Container" section remains same for all "Cards" "Post" and alll... easy
