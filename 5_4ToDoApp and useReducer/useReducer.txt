###### Context API ###### we used here when
we are using it when our "state" is common between "multiple Components"

But 

###### "useReducer" ###### <---- 1) use when we wan't to "update" and "Maintain" our "State" for "complex state logic"
2) It is an "Advance version of "useState"

we did "useReducer" in "App.jsx"

   // syntax of "useReducer"
  // const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)

"Reducer" --> is "Pure Function" tale "current State" and "Action" and --> return "new State"
"Action" ---> is "Obj" which discribing "what happend"

########## Here Cycle Goes like ##########

1) <Component /> i.e (EventHandler) --> 2) Dispatcher ---> 3) Reducer user Created Function i.e Pure Function ----> 4) State --> 1) Again <Component /> i.e (EventHandler) $$$$ Same loop $$$$
