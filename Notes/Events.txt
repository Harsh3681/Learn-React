 


We can pass events on button 
1) we need to use "Cammel Case" text like ----> onClick = {here name of function}

2) we need to define specific function for "Events" to perform certain operation and
need to pass into curly barces;

3) Ex. for onClick event in "expense project "ProductInput.jsx" file i creare an 
"getItem" function which will help me to return the user input.

4) we can add "event" obj also along with "Events"
ex.

    onClick = {(e) => name_Of_funct(e)} can return this "e" object from function

const name_Of_funct = (e) =>{
    consol.log(e);
}
