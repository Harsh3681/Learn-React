We use "useEffect" in "PostList" file.


UseEffect nothing but "Funct Base" Component
help for 
1) Data Fetching or event Listining And it run automatically on every "render"

2) By providing "Dependency Array" --> [] , "UseEffect" will runs when specific Variable is changing.
"Empty Array" --> [] means ---> "Effect Runs only once (1)"

// ""Dependency Array"" means here inside that array [] we can give the "props" "state" "funct" anything, whenever there value change our "useEffect" will re-render 

3) We can use "Multiple Effect Hooks" in single Component

4) UseEffect also return 1 method at it's end to "Clear the Intervals"
    when our Component got dead i.e we calling to any "network" or setting "Interval" at that time we can call
     return () =>{ clearInterval(myTime) } <--- can do like this
