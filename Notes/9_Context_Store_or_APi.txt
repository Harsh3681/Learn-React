Context API is common sharing storage among different Components.


1) 1st we decleared an 
    const PostList =  createContext({        // it is basically simple api structure, methods and all structure we declred there.

                      })

2) 2nd we create our Normal Component. and take props name as children {children} <--- which is from App.jsx
    and this normal Component will return via object created by 1st step i.e "PostList" and  value={{ }} <--- we must need there see below

const MyPostComponent = ({children}) =>{
    return <PostList.Provider  value={{ }} > {children} </PostList.Provider>
};

export default MyPostComponent;

3) IN 3rd step we need to create  "useReducer" to handle "multiple states"

const [getPost, dispatchUserPost] = useReducer(UserPostReducer, []);  // <---- "useReducer" 1st argument is one funct and 2nd is default value i.e mostly [] <-- 

And "UserPostReducer" <----- is funct which we define outside our "Normal Component" i.e "MyPostComponent"

4) How we define it after decleared see ðŸ‘‡
const UserPostReducer = (currStateOfPost, action) =>{   // also take 2 argument 1st "currentState" 2nd "Action" need to perform

}
