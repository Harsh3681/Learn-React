1) As well as any other function starting with “use”, is called a Hook.

2) hook canot use with "Normal JS" it only possible to use with "Other Components"

3) The "useState Hook" provides those two things:

    i) A "state variable" to retain the data between renders.
    ii) A "state setter function" to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.

###### NOTE ######

When you call useState, you are telling React that you want this component to "remember something":

const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

NOTE --> name this pair [index, setIndex] You could name it anything you like

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### component multiple state variables ###### Yes it's possible
EX.

    const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
    const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

This component has two state variables, a number index and a boolean showMore

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

###### State is isolated and private ######
you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state! 
"Changing one of them will not affect the other".
