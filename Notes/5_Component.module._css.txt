Here when component contains multiple CSS having some time same name
like our project got big-big with time and peoples define there CSS 
for same component which has already define by some peoples.

Then it's gaon a be very complex

that's why modular CSS introduce.

if want define css for specific component then css file name is like
name of ########## component.module.css ##########

and also we need to import the CSS file where we need to use it.
like    import <any name we can metioned here let's #### mystyle ####> fron ./file_location
